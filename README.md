# Spam questions detection on coding QnA platform

1. In this project, we detected spam questions on a coding QnA platform and classified them into valid, irrelevant, low-quality, and not reproducible questions.
2. In this project, we performed EDA, text preprocessing (Lemmatization), and hyperparameter tuning and used various word embeddings like Hashing vectorizer, Bag of words, TFIDF, Average word2vec, Tfidf word2vec.
3. We have also used different models like Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes, multinomial na√Øve bayes, random forest, bagging, boosting, and logistic_regression.
4. Technologies used: Python
5. Libraries used: scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas libraries in python
